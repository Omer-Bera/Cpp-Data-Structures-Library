# C++ Data Structures

This repository contains C++ implementations of common data structures and algorithms that I wrote to understand how they work under the hood.

Please note that this code is written solely for educational purposes.

## Files

* **`DynamicArrayList.cpp`**: A manual implementation of a dynamic array (logic similar to `std::vector`).
* **`BinaryTree.cpp`**: A simple Binary Search Tree (BST) implementation.
* **`HashTable.cpp`**: Hash map implementation exploring collision handling methods.
* **`LagrangeInterpolation.cpp`**: An example of Lagrange polynomial interpolation.
